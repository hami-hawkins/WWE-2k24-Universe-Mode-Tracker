# WWE 2k Universe Mode Tracker
I'm building this app as it is something I've longed after for many years when playing the WWE 2k games. While there is a reasonably robust Universe Mode - essentially a fantasy booking mode for WWE - there is no way to keep track of wins, losses, tournmanets, etc etc. So let's fix that!

## MVP Features
- Superstar Draft (Raw, Smackdown, NXT)
- Add custom superstars to draft pool
- Weekly / Monthly Planner
- Edit superstar info

## Stretch
#### Draft Features
- Redraft particular superstars after the draft while leaving others as they are
#### Planner
- Customisable calendar events
- Change match-card size
#### Other
- Win / Loss / Draw Statistics
- Championship history
- Rivaly tracking
